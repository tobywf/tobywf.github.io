<p>Minecraft is great, but mining long shafts - especially initially, with a slow pickaxe - requires holding down a mouse button for way too long. Sure, I could cheat. Or, I could build a mouse that uses foot pedals.</p>
<h2 id="a-small-mouse">A small mouse</h2>
<p>You’d think travel mice would be great for this. And they are, especially because you might have one lying around (often given away as swag) - except for the cord. Instead, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01FABWDU8/">this small “children’s” mouse (Amazon link)</a> with a proper cord. It was USD $7 (excluding tax).</p>
<p>I had a few false starts trying to find the screws. They’re usually under the anti-friction pads, and you can see my rough attempts to lift these. On this mouse, there’s only one screw under a QC sticker:</p>
<p><img alt="Unscrewing the single screw keeping the mouse body together" src="https://tobywf.com/2019/12/footmouse/images/2019-12-21-footmouse-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>It comes apart very easily, and the micro switches look quite decent. There’s three - left, right, and middle (under the scroll wheel):</p>
<p><img alt="The opened mouse" src="https://tobywf.com/2019/12/footmouse/images/2019-12-21-footmouse-02.jpg" /></p>
<p>The PCB is a lot smaller than the body, which is good. It’s just under 7cm x 3cm, and just 1.5cm high once the scroll wheel is removed:</p>

<h2 id="foot-pedal-jack-and-project-box">Foot pedal, jack, and project box</h2>
<p>There are many foot pedals for music keyboards and digital pianos. There’s two general styles: a spring-loaded flat box, and a more traditional pedal. For the flat box, I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WU6FDOK/">this cheap sustain pedal (Amazon link)</a>. It cost USD $11 USD (excluding tax). I already have an <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063678K/">M Audio SP 2 (Amazon link)</a> for my digital piano. It feels much sturdier (it’s heavier) and the travel is nicer. At USD $19 (excluding tax), it’s a steal and well worth the upgrade.</p>
<p>As far as I know, all pedals use a 6.35mm (1/4 inch) mono phone/headphone jack. So, you’ll also need matching jacks. I got <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01HYBC6P4/">6 cheap mono jacks (Amazon links)</a> for USD $12. There are nicer, sturdier jacks, but this won’t see that many unplug cycles. You can get these in a few places, so shop around. (Not shown are the mounting washers and flat hex nuts for the jacks.)</p>
<p>I guess you could do without the jacks, and solder the pedal directly to the mouse PCB, but that makes storage difficult. Swapping pedals around is a nice feature. For Minecraft, I mainly want the left mouse button, but you never know in future.</p>
<p>Finally, a project box makes any project look much neater, and adds ruggedness. Mine was 80 x 50 x 26 mm, but it was a pretty tight fit. I’d recommend something taller if you can get it. If you’re interested, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q14K8YT/">mine were also from Amazon</a> and pretty decent.</p>

<h2 id="build-time">Build time</h2>
<p>Overall, this build took less than two hours. I got a bit carried away, and didn’t take many pictures. Desoldering the micro switches was very easy. I attached 7cm wires to the PCB and jacks. This was a bit too long for the nearest jack and almost too short for the furthest jack. A bit more planning here would help. I tested all of the jacks before proceeding.</p>
<p>I put tape over the optical sensor, so if the PCB jiggles around, the cursor won’t move.</p>
<p>The fit was quite tight:</p>
<p><img alt="The jacks soldered to the PCB, with the holes drilled" src="https://tobywf.com/2019/12/footmouse/images/2019-12-21-footmouse-05.jpg" /></p>
<p>The holes needed to be bigger than 6.35mm. I slowly drilled the holes out, and went bigger until it fit. The fit isn’t too important here, as they come with a washer and flat hex nut. In the picture, the long tabs on the jack are down towards the PCB. I decided to flip these to the top, as they flex up when the plug is inserted. As I said, it was a tight fit. I cut a notch for the USB cable, and tied a knot in it to provide strain relief. The wires attaching it to the PCB look pretty flimsy.</p>
<p>With a label, it looks almost professional:</p>

<p>So does it work? Yes, it works great, although I prefer the M Audio pedal. But the longer USB cable than a travel mouse would have is a boon. Job done!</p>
