    <p>The British outrage over Trump&#8217;s latest remarks show a disturbing lack of&nbsp;thinking.</p>
<p>On one level, it shows no thought of possible different perspectives. If I was American, and the British said they hated someone, I&#8217;d not only still vote for them, I&#8217;d be more likely to vote for them - what an endorsement! (N.B.: <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/donald-trump/12044983/Donald-Trump-muslims-New-Hampshire-Muhammad-Ali-UK-petition-latest-news-live.html">This seems to be happening</a>, if only I was quicker at writing these&nbsp;posts.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to see how he could have provoked more of a response. Even <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=mitt+romney+olympics">Mitt Romney</a> failed to do that, by insulting the country directly. And this is why it&#8217;s particularly stupid, because Trump&#8217;s game is <em>succ√®s de scandale</em> <sup id="fnref-1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn-1">1</a></sup>. He&#8217;s mastered offline click-bait. Do that, and you get this brain-dead, knee-jerk socially correct response. Pavlov would be&nbsp;proud.</p>
<p>This also requires the assumption that your opinion on the matter is important. Most opinions aren&#8217;t important, let alone well informed. Who cares? (I know you don&#8217;t, I learned this the hard way via page view statistics.) If only people were so engaged in more important&nbsp;topics.</p>
<p>Finally, the <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/114003">petition</a> calling for a ban is also thoughtless. Can we pause for a minute and consider how passive-aggressive petitions are? It&#8217;s like trying to institutionalise mob rule. But I&nbsp;digress.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one reason why. If it succeeds, you then have a diplomatic crisis on hand when the President of the <span class="caps">USA</span> is &#8220;banned&#8221; from your country - who incidentally you inadvertently help get elected but were trying not to. (I&#8217;m not <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/114907">the only person</a> to apply a bit of logic.) Although I wouldn&#8217;t mind experiencing the number of headlines involving the words &#8220;Trump&#8221; and &#8220;card&#8221; if he got banned <em>and</em> elected&nbsp;president&#8230;</p>

<p>At least I think it is. Alas, I don&#8217;t know America as well as Trump&#8217;s advisers do. But the parallels between Corbyn and Trump support this in my mind, as Corbyn also could do no wrong during a series of &#8220;gaffes&#8221; - less crass, sure, but close.&#160;<a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref-1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></p>
