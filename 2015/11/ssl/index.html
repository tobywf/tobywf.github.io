    <p>Finally got round to sorting out <span class="caps">SSL</span>. Until GitHub Pages supports <span class="caps">SSL</span>, I&#8217;m using <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> like so many others. So far, it&#8217;s been a great experience. The setup instructions were incredibly clear, and the free account tier didn&#8217;t hurt&nbsp;either.</p>
<p>I think for <del>some</del> most tech products, a free tier makes sense. It&#8217;s the easiest way to get engineers to buy your product. I know I would use both GitHub and CloudFlare vs. either trying to do it myself or using a proprietary service that isn&#8217;t as upfront. This is something major tech companies have been terrible to pick up. I don&#8217;t know where this comes from. It&#8217;s possible this is simply an effect of being an outdated, big tech company with several layers of <del>bullshit</del> sales people between your engineers and your customers engineers. Possibly, most &#8220;enterprise&#8221; products being sold are actually horrible P.o.S. which need that kind of abstraction because you can&#8217;t be honest with your&nbsp;customers.</p>
<p>Wow, that got off track quickly. I might have to follow this up in a separate post! The hardest thing was probably making sure that my website contained no &#8220;http://&#8221; links, which would result in mixed security content and undermine <span class="caps">SSL</span>. Chrome and Firefox rightly protest if this happens though, you&#8217;ve just got to catch them&nbsp;all.</p>
