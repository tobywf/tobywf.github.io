<p>I love Python. And Python’s ecosystem is great. But starting Python can be
rocky. So here’s some random miscellaneous tips I remember getting people set
up.</p>
<p>In general, <a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python</a>
is a great resource.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use Python 3.8, 3.7, or 3.6 if you must. Don’t use anything below 3.6</li>
<li>Know what <a href="https://pypi.org/">PyPI</a> is</li>
<li>Always use virtual environments…</li>
<li>… but you don’t need to install <code>virtualenv</code>, as Python 3 has <code>venv</code> built in</li>
<li>Also, there are other options of managing virtual environments, like <code>poetry</code>
or <code>pipenv</code></li>
<li>Consider setting <code>PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV</code> in your <code>.profile</code> or equivalent</li>
<li>Consider using <a href="https://python-poetry.org/">poetry</a>, but only if you like it
and it makes sense to you. It’s completely fine not to use it, too</li>
<li><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is great, but very complex. Unless
you know you’ll need the features Django offers, it’s easier to start with
<a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com">Flask</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="use-a-recent-python-3-version">Use a recent Python 3 version</h2>
<p><a href="https://devguide.python.org/devcycle/#end-of-life-branches">Python 2 is dead</a>.
If you start off with Python 2 now, you are setting yourself up for a hard time
in the future. Give yourself a fighting chance and use Python 3.</p>
<p>Many systems still come with Python 2, this is okay. You can run both Python 2
and Python 3. To check if you have Python 3 installed, you can usually just
check if you have an executable called <code>python3</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>python3 --version
</code></pre></div>

<p>Although you may need to check specific versions like <code>python3.8</code>, <code>python3.7</code>,
or <code>python3.6</code>. These binary names are codified in the <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0394/">Python Enhancement
Proposal (PEP 394)</a>, although of
course <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0397/">Windows doesn’t behave</a>. In
general, using Windows will be more painful.</p>
<p>Python 3.8 is very stable. Don’t run anything below 3.6, and newer is better.
You’ll miss out on some neat, new features that can make life easier if you
aren’t running 3.7 or 3.8.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-note-on-pypi">A quick note on PyPI</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://pypi.org/">Python Package Index</a>, or PyPI for short, is where you
can easily download packages to use in your project. We’ll go over the tools
that make this easy, but you should know what PyPI is.</p>
<h2 id="understanding-virtual-environments">Understanding virtual environments</h2>
<p>I wish I didn’t have to explain this, but virtual environments are pretty much
required in practice, so here we go. Stick with me.</p>
<h3 id="why-do-i-need-a-virtual-environment">Why do I need a virtual environment?</h3>
<p>In theory, it should be as simple as <code>pip install &lt;cool-library&gt;</code>. But will this
use Python 2 or Python 3? If you’re clever, you might try and use <code>pip3 install &lt;cool-library&gt;</code> (if your system provides this command). This is only slightly
better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, <code>pip</code> installs packages into your global, system-wide Python
installation. But this can very easily break other installed stuff. Fixing this
is a major headache; it isn’t worth it.</p>
<p>To be fair, Python does have a good solution - a virtual environment aka.
virtualenv. There require a bit more setup, but are totally worth it.</p>
<p>Virtual environments set up a separate environment that keeps stuff away from
your global Python installation, and is easy to wipe away. This means it’s no
big deal if stuff gets messed up.</p>
<h3 id="virtualenv-and-venv">virtualenv and venv</h3>
<p>TL;DR: Don’t install <code>virtualenv</code>, e.g. via <code>pip install virtualenv</code>. Use
<code>venv</code>!</p>
<p>There is an old package that is called <code>virtualenv</code>, but in Python 3, it’s
unnecessary to install. Python 3 comes with it’s own virtualenv utility, which
works fine. Although on e.g. Ubuntu, for some dumb reason, you’ll have to
install that via <code>python3-venv</code> first.</p>
<p>This is how you create a virtual environment:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>python3 -m venv env
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>env</code> is actually what the directory containing the virtualenv will be
called. Idiomatically, <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/18aa6d83774d514da479d73a4beb864cd4220231/Python.gitignore#L110-L111">it’s usually called <code>env</code> or
<code>venv</code></a>.
Pick one of these, many tools will auto-detect them (like that default Python
<code>.gitignore</code>, or IDEs). I’m going to assume you called it <code>env</code>, which I picked
because it’s a bit less confusing than two <code>venv</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, before you can use the virtualenv, you have to “activate” it.
This basically sets things like <code>python</code> or <code>pip</code> to point to the virtualenv
versions. For e.g. bash, you do this by typing:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>env/bin/activate.bash
</code></pre></div>

<p>Once activated, your shell usually displays some kind of indication it’s active,
e.g. by showing <code>(env)</code> in the prompt:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="gp">$ </span>which python
<span class="go">/usr/bin/python</span>
<span class="gp">$ </span>python3 -m venv env
<span class="gp">$ </span><span class="nb">source</span> env/bin/activate
<span class="gp gp-VirtualEnv">(env)</span> <span class="gp">$ </span>which python
<span class="go">/home/me/env/bin/python</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you close your terminal, or open a new window or tab, you’ll have to
re-activate the virtualenv. Also, if you use an IDE, you’ll have to set it to
use the virtualenv, too. Here’s how to do that in
<a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-environment.html">PyCharm</a>
and <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments">VSCode</a>. I believe
PyCharm can also create a virtualenv for you.</p>
<p>Finally, consider setting <code>PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV</code> to <code>true</code>. With bash, you’d
add this to your <code>~/.profile</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="nb">true</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><a href="https://docs.python-guide.org/dev/pip-virtualenv/">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to
Python</a> has more options on
how to set this up on e.g. Windows.</p>
<p>As the name suggests, this will save you from accidentally running <code>pip install</code>
without a virtualenv activated, and so prevent you from messing up the system
installation. It has saved me many times.</p>
<h3 id="requirementstxt">requirements.txt</h3>
<p>To allow other people to create a virtualenv to match yours, the common way of
doing this is using a file called <code>requirements.txt</code>. You put your requirements
in that, and then someone else can install them all at once using:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre></div>

<p>In it’s simplest form, it’s just one line per package you’d install via <code>pip install</code>, so for example:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>requests
flask
</code></pre></div>

<p>To install those two packages. It can be more complex, for example you can also
specify which versions are needed, e.g. if you depend on a minimum version.
Keeping a <code>requirements.txt</code> file from the start is a good idea, but also
tedious (although maybe less tedious than figuring it out later).</p>
<h3 id="alternatives-to-venv-pipenv-poetry">Alternatives to venv (pipenv, poetry)</h3>
<p>These alternatives make managing a virtualenv easier, but also bring more
complexity. I believe understanding <code>venv</code> is important, and hiding it only
hurts Python beginners in the long run. It’s an important part of Python, even
if it is unfortunate. That said, managing virtualenvs and requirements is tedious.</p>
<h4 id="pipenv">pipenv</h4>
<p>The author of “The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python” also wrote <code>pipenv</code>, which
explains why he pushes it so hard. This post isn’t the place to go into detail,
but there’s controversy around <code>pipenv</code>. Apart from the controversy - which is
also tedious - the reason I don’t like <code>pipenv</code> is mundane: you <a href="https://pipenv-fork.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basics.html#specifying-versions-of-python">can’t specify
Python 3.x or
higher</a>,
you have to pick exactly one. For some scenarios, this is fine, but it can also
turn into a hassle if you want to share your code.</p>
<p>TL;DR: I would avoid <code>pipenv</code>.</p>
<h4 id="poetry">poetry</h4>
<p><a href="https://python-poetry.org/">Poetry</a> is a fairly new project, but does everything right - for me.</p>
<p>It’s easy to set up, this will create a new folder for you project:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>poetry new &lt;project&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Alternatively, you can use <code>poetry init</code> for existing projects.</p>
<p>It makes managing requirements easy. You just run this command, and it keeps
track of them for you - no more manually updating <code>requirements.txt</code>:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>poetry add &lt;cool-library&gt;
</code></pre></div>

<p>It also can keep track of development dependencies, like unit test libraries.
Usually, this is a right pain requiring a second requirements file, often called
<code>requirements-dev.txt</code>, but with poetry, it’s simply:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>poetry add --dev pytest
</code></pre></div>

<p>Installing the virtualenv is also easy:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>poetry install
</code></pre></div>

<p>This is also what other people can run when they download your project.
Activating the virtualenv is also easy:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>poetry shell
</code></pre></div>

<p>As I said, poetry is fairly new, and you’ll have to get used to some terminology
being different. You no longer need to manually make a virtualenv, the
<code>pyproject.toml</code> file replaces <code>setup.py</code>, <code>setup.cfg</code>, and <code>requirements.txt</code>.
But poetry does simplify workflows, including building artefacts or publishing
your project to PyPI. I’m 100% happy with it, and can easily recommend it, even
for beginners.</p>
<h2 id="django">Django</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> is a great - if not the greatest - web
framework, with loads of features. But it crushes even advanced Python users
with a lot of complexity and Django-specific knowledge. Unless you are using
Django in a professional (i.e. paid), customer-facing project, or you know you
absolutely need many of the features Django offers, other options are available.</p>
<p><a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> is also great, but very different.
It’s a “micro”-framework, so the way you get more features is by using add-ons.
This means it’s relatively simple, although you’ll have to slowly add things,
and not all add-ons are as good. But it grows with you, and the templating
engine is easily the best there is.</p>
<p>Flask makes projects fun, and so increases your change of success. I have
written many an internal tool in Flask. It’s quick to get started, quick to get
working, and quick to deploy. It’s a real joy. Flask is surprisingly capable.</p>
<p>And should you need to, it isn’t too horrible to port Flask projects to Django.
They share a lot of DNA. I’m not going to pretend it’s easy. But getting a proof
of concept running in Flask is a lot easier, and a trade-off I would make. If
you ever find yourself in the situation of having to port to Django, that’s a
success already in my books. Make no mistake, Flask is very capable and
shouldn’t be seen as less professional. But there’s no denying Django offers
more for e.g. big e-commerce projects, or when you need some CRM aspects for
business reasons.</p>

<p>I hope this helps you get started with Python, or helps you tame some Python
projects you had lying around!</p>
