<p>Using a static site generator (SSG) isn’t a new idea, but it’s a great idea. Security, ease of use, and future-proofing/avoiding lock-in are totally worth it. Hosting is dirt cheap. In 2016, there are an abundance of SSGs - I’d argue too many. But in 2013, when I first started thinking about this, there weren’t as many mature projects. So I made the situation worse by writing my own SSG using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a>. And it works well, with not too many lines of code.</p>
<p>But for no particular reason, I decided to switch. I think it’s because I know that maintaining code is always underestimated. But which project to pick?</p>
<p>The most well-known SSG is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and it’s well thought out. But there’s no way in hell I’m using Ruby; I hate almost everything about Ruby (but that’s for another post - all I’ll say now is that Ruby <a href="http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/2012/10/03/ruby-1.8.7-1.9.3-migration/">breaks between minor version numbers</a>). So maybe something Python exists? IMO, SSGs don’t need to be fully featured, but should be hackable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: Ruby - nope</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo">Hugo</a>: It’s GoLang, it’s fast… I’d rather have simple</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">Cactus</a>: Django templates instead of Jinja2</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">Hyde</a>: No Python 3 support? Are you serious?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">Nikola</a>: Way to complicated, even though they claim simplicity. Just look at the files in the repo. <a href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#supported-input-formats">PHP support</a> - wat? (However, the build system looks seriously good)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lektor/lektor">Lektor</a>: I generally love anything <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a> does, but Lektor seems to be focussed more on the content management aspect with an admin interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I found <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>. Python 3, check. Jinja2 templates, check. Great API, check. The migration went well because I was already using a “Jekyll-compatible” markdown format. Attachments are a great way to manage files. The code-base is nice.</p>
<p>It isn’t completely perfect. Linking to other posts via the slug would be nice, and I’m sure easily doable. The periodic archive generation sucks because it uses the same template for year/month/day and the data that gets passed to those templates is also unstructured. But thanks to the API, I just wrote my own plugin to generate archives just as I want them, in about 50 lines of code.</p>
<p>There are other quirks. For me, attachments and other links in pages written in HTML weren’t being processed. To fix this, I replaced the overly-complicated default HTML reader with my own, that basically just reads the file. For some reason, this just works - so why doesn’t it out of the box? The build system is okay. The build scripts are terrible. Handling different settings via <code>from x import *</code> is horrible and hacky - expect a future blog post for a much better solution. Asset management is limited, it’s either <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/plugins.html#asset-management">webassets</a> or nothing.</p>
<p>All of that aside, I’m very happy with Pelican, largely due to the hackability. Highly recommended for Pythoneers.</p>
