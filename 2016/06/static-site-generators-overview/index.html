<p>Using a static site generator (<span class="caps">SSG</span>) isn&#8217;t a new idea, but it&#8217;s a great idea. Security, ease of use, and future-proofing/avoiding lock-in are totally worth it. Hosting is dirt cheap. In 2016, there are an abundance of SSGs - I&#8217;d argue too many. But in 2013, when I first started thinking about this, there weren&#8217;t as many mature projects. So I made the situation worse by writing my own <span class="caps">SSG</span> using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/">Flask</a> and <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/Frozen-Flask/">Frozen-Flask</a>. And it works well, with not too many lines of&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>But for no particular reason, I decided to switch. I think it&#8217;s because I know that maintaining code is always underestimated. But which project to&nbsp;pick?</p>
<p>The most well-known <span class="caps">SSG</span> is <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, and it&#8217;s well thought out. But there&#8217;s no way in hell I&#8217;m using Ruby; I hate almost everything about Ruby (but that&#8217;s for another post - all I&#8217;ll say now is that Ruby <a href="http://www.darkridge.com/~jpr5/2012/10/03/ruby-1.8.7-1.9.3-migration/">breaks between minor version numbers</a>). So maybe something Python exists? <span class="caps">IMO</span>, SSGs don&#8217;t need to be fully featured, but should be&nbsp;hackable.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>: Ruby -&nbsp;nope</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/spf13/hugo">Hugo</a>: It&#8217;s GoLang, it&#8217;s fast&#8230; I&#8217;d rather have&nbsp;simple</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/eudicots/Cactus">Cactus</a>: Django templates instead of&nbsp;Jinja2</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hyde/hyde">Hyde</a>: No Python 3 support? Are you&nbsp;serious?</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/getnikola/nikola">Nikola</a>: Way to complicated, even though they claim simplicity. Just look at the files in the repo. <a href="https://getnikola.com/handbook.html#supported-input-formats"><span class="caps">PHP</span> support</a> - wat? (However, the build system looks seriously&nbsp;good)</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/lektor/lektor">Lektor</a>: I generally love anything <a href="https://github.com/mitsuhiko">Armin Ronacher</a> does, but Lektor seems to be focussed more on the content management aspect with an admin&nbsp;interface</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, I found <a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican">Pelican</a>. Python 3, check. Jinja2 templates, check. Great <span class="caps">API</span>, check. The migration went well because I was already using a &#8220;Jekyll-compatible&#8221; markdown format. Attachments are a great way to manage files. The code-base is&nbsp;nice.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t completely perfect. Linking to other posts via the slug would be nice, and I&#8217;m sure easily doable. The periodic archive generation sucks because it uses the same template for year/month/day and the data that gets passed to those templates is also unstructured. But thanks to the <span class="caps">API</span>, I just wrote my own plugin to generate archives just as I want them, in about 50 lines of&nbsp;code.</p>
<p>There are other quirks. For me, attachments and other links in pages written in <span class="caps">HTML</span> weren&#8217;t being processed. To fix this, I replaced the overly-complicated default <span class="caps">HTML</span> reader with my own, that basically just reads the file. For some reason, this just works - so why doesn&#8217;t it out of the box? The build system is okay. The build scripts are terrible. Handling different settings via <code>from x import *</code> is horrible and hacky - expect a future blog post for a much better solution. Asset management is limited, it&#8217;s either <a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/plugins.html#asset-management">webassets</a> or&nbsp;nothing.</p>
<p>All of that aside, I&#8217;m very happy with Pelican, largely due to the hackability. Highly recommended for&nbsp;Pythoneers.</p>
