<p><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>: Sonos speakers are amazing - too bad the software is awful. Google is
taking full advantage of&nbsp;this.</p>
<hr />
<p>A while back, I was looking for speakers for a second room. The living room
already contains the very nice <a href="http://audioengineusa.com/Store/A5-plus-B-Powered-Speakers">AudioEngine A5+</a>
bookshelf speakers, which I&#8217;ve used with Airplay in the past. (Airplay isn&#8217;t
really comparable to Sonos or Chromecast, because it needs a client streaming
the audio, i.e. if you turn off your <span class="caps">PC</span> or phone, the music&nbsp;stops.)</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I committed to Sonos and bought two <span class="caps">PLAY</span>:1 speakers. They are
beautifully designed, and sound amazing for such a small form factor. And all
they need is a power cable. I was pretty happy with the purchase, but over time
the small annoyances grew. And&nbsp;grew.</p>
<p>Then Google announced the Chromecast Audio. And then they delivered multi-room
support, which was Sonos&#8217; big&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what have Sonos been doing the last years? Barely new hardware
refreshes, lack of software improvements, and sluggish/incomplete support for
3rd party&nbsp;services.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to tell you all the issues I had. Sonos can work for people who want
a very simple setup, but otherwise, you&#8217;ll hit the edge of the walled garden
quickly. At that point, I hope you haven&#8217;t invested too heavily in Sonos or
can live with the&nbsp;limitations.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="installation">Installation</h2>
<p>The Sonos speaker installation is easy, just unpack and plug them into power,
and optionally&nbsp;Ethernet.</p>
<p>Chromecast is slightly more hassle. I was lucky that
the A5+ have a <span class="caps">USB</span> charging port on the back, which means the Chromecast can
gets it&#8217;s power from there and doesn&#8217;t need an extra power plug. Obviously, the
flexibility of Chromecast requires this, but cables/power strips are not sexy
and that&#8217;s definitely an appealing aspect of the Sonos&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the biggest issue with Sonos: Line-in. Basically, if you want to connect
any existing systems (laptop, <span class="caps">TV</span>, record player), your options are few and
expensive (prices off Amazon.co.uk at the time of&nbsp;writing).</p>
<ul>
<li>Top of the line <span class="caps">PLAY</span>:5 (£389.00). The <span class="caps">PLAY</span>:1 and <span class="caps">PLAY</span>:3 <em>do not</em> have&nbsp;line-in</li>
<li><span class="caps">CONNECT</span>:<span class="caps">AMP</span> (£369.00). The <span class="caps">CONNECT</span> <em>does not</em> have line&nbsp;in</li>
<li><span class="caps">PLAYBAR</span>, (£599.00) optical in&nbsp;only</li>
</ul>
<p>It must be trivial to implement in software, and an 3.5mm jack + good <span class="caps">ADC</span> might
cost ~£5. The only reason it isn&#8217;t in the cheaper products is profit&nbsp;margins.</p>
<p>To be fair, Chromecast doesn&#8217;t support line-in, either. You&#8217;ll probably never
notice though. The Google ecosystem is broader, so there&#8217;s far less likelihood
you&#8217;ll need line-in. You can cast audio from Chrome, and Android phones.
Finally, the speakers the Chromecast is attached to obviously support arbitrary
audio, so worst case you have to unplug the Chromecast. It isn&#8217;t multi-room,
but at least your speakers aren&#8217;t paperweights. For a laptop or <span class="caps">TV</span>, I don&#8217;t use
multi-room&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>Winner: Chromecast, unless you&#8217;re 100% sure you&#8217;ll <em>never</em> want&nbsp;line-in.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The Sonos setup isn&#8217;t great, with a setup wizard that feels like it has 50
steps and could have been streamlined. Good thing you only have to do it once.
Chromecast on the other hand is as simple as it&nbsp;gets.</p>
<p>Winner:&nbsp;Chromecast</p>
<h2 id="apps">Apps</h2>
<p>The Chromecast app is only for setting up the device. 3rd party apps integrate
Google Cast support. While it does mean switching apps, it means there&#8217;s loads
of choice and robust playback&nbsp;support.</p>
<p>Sonos is the exact opposite. The Sonos app wants to do everything.
It should mean less switching and a better user experience.&nbsp;Nope!</p>
<p>The Sonos desktop app is hideous, and not user friendly. The styling and visual
cues don&#8217;t match the mobile app. It does work&nbsp;though.</p>
<p>The Sonos mobile apps are okay, but don&#8217;t feel as polished as Spotify or <span class="caps">BBC</span>
iPlayer. But Sonos&#8217; downfall is integration/interoperability. If Sonos doesn&#8217;t
support something, you&#8217;re out of luck. And this happens all the time, as we
will&nbsp;see.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t understand why Sonos didn&#8217;t have a thriving ecosystem full of apps and
plugins to fix the Sonos shortcomings. Surely techies love Sonos systems with
their great design, and they&#8217;d come up with solutions when Sonos can&#8217;t deliver,
either because of politics, or niche concerns. But Sonos doesn&#8217;t. So I had a
look at their development kits. All I can say is that the documentation is
incomprehensible, the sample applications are useless, and the technology is
based on some <span class="caps">XML</span> <span class="caps">SOAP</span> <span class="caps">RPC</span>. It&#8217;s 2016, can we not have <span class="caps">JSON</span> with a clear <span class="caps">API</span>
documentation? Everybody&nbsp;looses.</p>
<p>The only benefit for this approach is that if you want to create a playlist
with music from several sources (e.g. <span class="caps">NAS</span>, Google Play Music, Spotify) you can.
This isn&#8217;t something I&#8217;ve ever felt compelled to do though. The irony is that
Sonos doesn&#8217;t support that many options well, otherwise this could be a killer
feature for people who want to use several streaming services because the music
is different on&nbsp;each.</p>
<p>Winner: Let&#8217;s look at support for different services. I&#8217;ve picked the three
most popular in the <span class="caps">UK</span>, as well as having a local music&nbsp;library.</p>
<h3 id="spotify">Spotify</h3>
<p>Chromecast support: Flawless on mobile, a few issues if using the desktop app.
Sort of works using the web player + Chrome, but stutters and sounds bad.&nbsp;Avoid.</p>
<p>Sonos&#8217; Spotify integration is terrible, because their app <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=sonos+spotify">doesn&#8217;t support all
the features Spotify does</a>,
despite updates. I found myself managing my playlists in the Spotify app,
and then switching to Sonos to play those playlists. Mediocre&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<p>Winner:&nbsp;Chromecast</p>
<h3 id="bbc-iplayer-music"><span class="caps">BBC</span> iPlayer&nbsp;Music</h3>
<p>Chromecast support:&nbsp;Flawless.</p>
<p>Sonos doesn&#8217;t support the iPlayer directly, you have to use the Tune-in service
to listen to iPlayer. The problem is, Tune-in is for web radio. <em>There is no
way to listen to catch-up/on demand <span class="caps">BBC</span> shows on Sonos</em>. Ergo, Sonos doesn&#8217;t
really support the iPlayer, and judging by the forums they don&#8217;t plan on doing&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Winner:&nbsp;Chromecast</p>
<h3 id="google-play-music">Google Play&nbsp;Music</h3>
<p>This one is interesting, as the <span class="caps">GPM</span> app lets you stream stuff directly to&nbsp;Sonos!</p>
<p>Winner:&nbsp;Draw?</p>
<h3 id="nas-streaming"><span class="caps">NAS</span>&nbsp;streaming</h3>
<p>On Sonos, this works well in principle. But several annoyances do show up.
The least annoying, but still a gotcha, is that Sonos can only deal with <span class="caps">SMB</span>
shares. Second, the Sonos app wants to be the be all and end all, but you can&#8217;t
use it to add new music to the <span class="caps">NAS</span> (not even the desktop version). So you&#8217;ll
need a second app to manage your tunes, then you&#8217;ll have to keep the Sonos
index of your <span class="caps">NAS</span> up-to-date, and then you&#8217;ll have to add new songs to
playlists. By the way, Sonos doesn&#8217;t have a recently added&nbsp;playlist.</p>
<p>Winner: Will update once I&#8217;ve tested extensively on&nbsp;Chromecast.</p>
<h2 id="other-features">Other&nbsp;features</h2>
<p>Sonos can stream music stored on a mobile device. It struggled on my Android
device, with stuttering, and cut-outs. Besides, having your phone do the work
defeats the whole point of such a system. A line-in would have worked&nbsp;better.</p>
<p>Sonos does support sleep timers, and alarms. While nice, for me it&#8217;s pointless.
Sleep timers don&#8217;t really need multi-room support - a phone connected to a
speaker via line-in or bluetooth can do this. A shame Sonos supports&nbsp;neither.</p>
<hr />
<p>Needless to say I sold the <span class="caps">PLAY</span>:1, and I&#8217;m happy with the Chromecast Audio. It
isn&#8217;t quite as polished as Sonos - but it does work better. I can finally
listen to <span class="caps">BBC</span> catch-up, and enjoy Spotify&#8217;s great&nbsp;interface.</p>
<p>I do miss having small, discrete speakers in other rooms. I think I&#8217;ll survive.
Hopefully, some of the big manufacturers have got products to fill this niche
in the pipeline. A small, mains-powered speaker that support line-in,
bluetooth, and Google Cast would be ideal. Judging by previous efforts though,
probably&nbsp;not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll probably just build one myself. But that&#8217;s for another&nbsp;post.</p>
