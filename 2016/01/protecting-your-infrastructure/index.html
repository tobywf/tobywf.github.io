<p><span class="caps">TL</span>;<span class="caps">DR</span>: Ihis post isn&#8217;t very in-depth, because I don&#8217;t want to get on any hype train. But it took me ages to get the point of containers, and how using them is different from nothing or VMs. <span class="caps">IMO</span>, they&#8217;re just another tool to enforce the environment/separation you want. In an age where security is more important than ever but software seems to be getting more complicated, these tools can save you a <em>lot</em> of time and maybe even&nbsp;damage.</p>
<hr />
<p>This guide on <a href="http://blog.mailgun.com/security-guide-basic-infrastructure-security/">How to Protect Your Infrastructure Against the Basic Attacker</a> is excellent, and even includes many, many howtos. But there&#8217;s more than one way to skin a&nbsp;cat.</p>
<p>For those of you (non-sysadmins?) that read that post and said &#8220;sounds complicated&#8221;, fear not! Many of these points can be easily put into practice with containers. For example, the whole section of &#8220;Application/<span class="caps">OS</span> Hardening&#8221; is basically privilege separation - containers do this well. They also make enforcing the &#8220;Firewalls and Networking&#8221; easy, get the port wrong and nothing&nbsp;works.</p>
<p>I think most Docker articles I&#8217;ve ever read gloss over why and for what to use containers massively. Articles about <span class="caps">BSD</span> Jails are slightly better at explaining this. <strong>Containers are not VMs</strong>. Ideally you&#8217;ll have one process/application per container. The best applications to containerize are ones that use <span class="caps">TCP</span>/<span class="caps">IP</span> to connect to other applications, because getting data in and out of a container can be a bit tricky. Thanks to the rise of <a href="https://www.nginx.com/">nginx</a> as a reverse proxy, containerization of web-applications is simpler than&nbsp;ever.</p>
<p>Of course, all these rules are useless if not applied. For this, you&#8217;d use <span class="caps">IT</span> automation instead of doing it manually - after all, you want to re-apply these rules on any server consistently. I recommend <a href="http://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, but there are others like Salt, Chef, or Puppet. Ansible is especially useful, because you don&#8217;t need to install anything on the client. This is invaluable for bootstrapping containers (which I&#8217;m sure can be done with Chef, but it&#8217;s&nbsp;effort).</p>
