<p>It’s been a while since I played Minecraft. And oh man, there have been some changes. Of course, <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/java-edition-moving-house">Microsoft has forced everybody to migrate their accounts</a>. Then there’s drama around Minecraft launchers, with MultiMC being forked as PolyMC, and then PolyMC being forked as Prism Launcher. Anyway, <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/download/steam-deck/">Prism Launcher has a Steam Deck build</a>, so Prism it is.</p>
<p>Instantly, I hit the first issue: The account authentication failed in Prism Launcher. It turns out this is actually a Microsoft issue, because of course it is. It probably uses the same rubbish all Microsoft products use. Their login workflow is legit broken, as we’ll see.</p>
<p>The solution is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrismLauncher/comments/17rj1n0/microsoft_user_authentication_failed/">to enable password-based logins</a>, thank you <code>u/anonymous_3125</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>found the problem. That microsoft account was indeed faulty because it somehow didn’t have a password. I didn’t notice this at first, but every timed I tried to sign into the faulty ms account, it sent a code to an email and gave me no other sign in option. With the other ms account, it gave an option to send a code to an email or enter the password.</p>
<p>u/anonymous_3125</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, while trying to do this, I hit the same issue as another Reddit user:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had to brute force it through the microsoft security page where it keeps reloading and made a password that way.</p>
<p>u/Kqllanxus</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When I tried to view the account security page, I got stuck in a redirect/refresh loop. It’s quite unbelievable.</p>
<p>Even when writing this, it’s crap. I have a password manager, so my password is 32 random characters. I have two-factor authentication enabled. But Microsoft still prompts me to “Help keep your account safe and secure”, because “Passwords can be forgotten or stolen.”.</p>
<hr>
<p>Although I did fire up a Vanilla world, I was quickly craving some mods again - even if it is just for fast leaf decay. For nostalgia reasons, I wanted to play an old Direwolf20 modpack. Somehow, this turned into a bit of a saga.</p>
<p>First, Feed The Beast (FTB) sold out in some capacity to Overwolf, and now requires an ad-infested launcher on Windows. On Linux, it’s some shell-script. No thanks. All of this would be ok, except that FTB “requested” that <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/news/ftb-removal/">other launchers like Prism remove FTB modpack downloads</a> (<a href="https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/pull/1040">GitHub issue</a>). One solution might be to look for patched Prism Launchers which do enable FTB modpack downloads.</p>
<p>Now, I wanted to play the <a href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/modpacks/79-ftb-presents-direwolf20-116">Direwolf20 1.16 pack</a>, mainly because of Tinkers’ Construct. The 1.20 and 1.19 packs don’t have it. 1.18 would be an option, but for some reason I went with 1.16.</p>
<p>1.16 seems to need Java 8, and <a href="https://prismlauncher.org/wiki/getting-started/installing-java/#forge-1.16.5-and-java-8u321+">somehow Forge breaks with newer Java 8 versions</a>: “Old versions of Forge crash with Java 8u321+. For this reason, using Java 8u312 or lower is recommended”. The symptom for me was some Antlr issue:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>[org.antlr.v4.runtime.ConsoleErrorListener:syntaxError:38]: line 13:0 token recognition error at: &#39;`&#39;
</code></pre></div>

<p>Ok, but how to get Java 8u212 on the Steam Deck, into the Prism Launcher flatpak? Github user <a href="https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/issues/446"><code>barraIhsan</code> comes in with the save</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Flatpak Prism stores java in <code>/var/lib/flatpak/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/current/active/files/jdk</code> and in prism it will be replaced as <code>/app/jdk/</code>.</p>
<p>barraIhsan</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, browse the <a href="https://adoptium.net/temurin/archive/?version=8">Adoptium archives for Java 8</a>, find the closest Java 8u312 build which was <code>jdk8u312-b07</code>/<code>8.0.312+7</code>, and download the <a href="https://github.com/adoptium/temurin8-binaries/releases/download/jdk8u312-b07/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_8u312b07.tar.gz">Linux x64 Binary JDK</a> (103 MB).</p>
<p>Next, open up Konsole on the Steam Deck in desktop mode. To be able to use <code>sudo</code> on the Steam Deck, it’s necessary to set a password using <code>passwd</code>. Then, simply extract the JDK into the flatpak:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nb">cd</span> /var/lib/flatpak/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/current/active/files/jdk
sudo tar xvzf ~/Downloads/OpenJDK8U-jdk_x64_linux_hotspot_8u312b07.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>

<p>This creates a directory named <code>jdk8u312-b07</code>, which has the JDK in. That can be then used in the Prism Launcher as <code>/app/jdk/jdk8u312-b07/bin/java</code>, and finally, everything works!</p>
